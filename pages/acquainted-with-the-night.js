      <p>
        I have been one acquainted with the night.
        <br />
        I have walked out in rainâ€”and back in rain.
        <br />
        I have outwalked the furthest city light.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I have looked down the saddest city lane.
        <br />
        I have passed by the watchman on his beat
        <br />
        And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
        <br />
        When far away an interrupted cry
        <br />
        Came over houses from another street,
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        But not to call me back or say good-bye;
        <br />
        And further still at an unearthly height,
        <br />
        One luminary clock against the sky
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right. <br />
        I have been one acquainted with the night.
        <br />
