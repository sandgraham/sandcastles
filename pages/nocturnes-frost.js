      <h3>The Night Light</h3>
      <p>
        She always had to burn a light
        <br />
        Beside her attic bed at night.
        <br />
        It gave bad dreams and broken sleep,
        <br />
        But helped the Lord her soul to keep.
        <br />
        Good gloom on her was thrown away.
        <br />
        It is on me by night or day,
        <br />
        Who have as I suppose ahead
        <br />
        The darkness of it still to dread.
      </p>

      <h3>Were I In Trouble With Night Tonight</h3>
      <p>
        Where I could think of no thoroughfare,
        <br />
        Away on the mountain up far too high,
        <br />
        A blinding headlight shifted glare
        <br />
        And began to bounce down a granite stair
        <br />
        Like a star fresh fallen out of the sky.
        <br />
        And I away in my opposite wood
        <br />
        Am touched by that unintimate light
        <br />
        And made feel less alone than I rightly should,
        <br />
        For traveller there could do me no good
        <br />
        Were I in trouble with the night tonight.
      </p>

      <h3>Bravery</h3>
      <p>
        Have I not walked without an upward look
        <br />
        Of caution under stars that very well
        <br />
        Might not have missed me when they shot and fell?
        <br />
        It was a risk I had to takeâ€”and took.
