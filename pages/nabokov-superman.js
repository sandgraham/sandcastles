        I have to wear these glasses – otherwise,
        <br />
        when I caress her with my super-eyes,
        <br />
        her lungs and liver are too plainly seen
        <br />
        throbbing, like deep-sea creatures, in between
        <br />
        dim bones. Oh, I am sick of loitering here,
        <br />
        a banished trunk (like my namesake in “Lear”),
        <br />
        but when I switch to tights, still less I prize
        <br />
        my splendid torso, my tremendous thighs,
        <br />
        the dark-blue forelock on my narrow brow,
        <br />
        the heavy jaw; for I shall tell you now
        <br />
        my fatal limitation … not the pact
        <br />
        between the worlds of Fantasy and Fact
        <br />
        which makes me shun such an attractive spot
        <br />
        as Berchtesgaden, say; and also not
        <br />
        that little business of my draft; but worse:
        <br />
        a tragic misadjustment and a curse.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m young and bursting with prodigious sap,
        <br />
        and I’m in love like any healthy chap –<br />
        and I must throttle my dynamic heart
        <br />
        for marriage would be murder on my part,
        <br />
        an earthquake, wrecking on the night of nights
        <br />
        a woman’s life, some palmtrees, all the lights,
        <br />
        the big hotel, a smaller one next door
        <br />
        and half a dozen army trucks – or more.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        But even if that blast of love should spare
        <br />
        her fragile frame – what children would she bear?
        <br />
        What monstrous babe, knocking the surgeon down,
        <br />
        would waddle out into the awestruck town?
        <br />
        When two years old he’d break the strongest chairs,
        <br />
        fall through the floor and terrorize the stairs;
        <br />
        at four, he’d dive into a well; at five,
        <br />
        explore a roaring furnace – and survive;
        <br />
        at eight, he’d ruin the longest railway line
        <br />
        by playing trains with real ones; and at nine,
        <br />
        release all my old enemies from jail,
        <br />
        and then I’d try to break his head – and fail.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        So this is why, no matter where I fly,
        <br />
        red-cloaked, blue-hosed, across the yellow sky,
        <br />
        I feel no thrill in chasing thugs and thieves –<br />
        and gloomily broad-shouldered Kent retrieves
        <br />
        his coat and trousers from the garbage can
        <br />
        and tucks away the cloak of Superman;
        <br />
        and when she sighs – somewhere in Central Park
        <br />
        where my immense bronze statue looms – “Oh, Clark …<br />
        Isn’t he wonderful!?!”, I stare ahead
        <br />
        and long to be a normal guy instead.
