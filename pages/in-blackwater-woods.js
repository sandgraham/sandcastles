      <p>
        Nature's first green is gold,
        <br />
        Her hardest hue to hold.
        <br />
        Her early leaf's a flower;
        <br />
        But only so an hour.
        <br />
        Then leaf subsides to leaf.
        <br />
        So Eden sank to grief,
        <br />
        So dawn goes down to day.
        <br />
        Nothing gold can stay.
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Look, the trees
        <br />
        are turning
        <br />
        their own bodies
        <br />
        into pillars
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        of light,
        <br />
        are giving off the rich
        <br />
        fragrance of cinnamon
        <br />
        and fulfillment,
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        the long tapers
        <br />
        of cattails
        <br />
        are bursting and floating away over
        <br />
        the blue shoulders
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        of the ponds,
        <br />
        and every pond,
        <br />
        no matter what its
        <br />
        name is, is
        <br />
        nameless now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every year
        <br />
        everything
        <br />
        I have ever learned
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        in my lifetime
        <br />
        leads back to this:
        <br />
        the fires
        <br />
        and the black river of loss
        <br />
        whose other side
      </p>

      <p>
        is salvation,
        <br />
        whose meaning
        <br />
        none of us will ever know.
        <br />
        To live in this world
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        you must be able
        <br />
        to do three things:
        <br />
        to love what is mortal;
        <br />
        to hold it
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        against your bones knowing
        <br />
        your own life depends on it;
        <br />
        and, when the time comes to let it go,
        <br />
        to let it go.
        <br />
