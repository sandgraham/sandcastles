        <h1>Tao Te Ching (55)</h1>
        <p>
          He who is filled with Virtue is like a newborn child.<br />
          Wasps and serpents will not sting him;<br />
          Wild beasts will not pounce upon him;<br />
          He will not be attacked by birds of prey.<br />
          His bones are soft, his muscles weak,<br />
          But his grip is firm.<br />
          He has not experienced the union of man and woman, but is whole.<br />
          His manhood is strong.<br />
          He screams all day without becoming hoarse.<br />
          This is perfect harmony.<br />
        <p>
        </p>
          Knowing harmony is constancy.<br />
          Knowing constancy is enlightenment.<br />
        <p>
        </p>
          It is not wise to rush about.<br />
          Controlling the breath causes strain.<br />
          If too much energy is used, exhaustion follows.<br />
          This is not the way of Tao.<br />
          Whatever is contrary to Tao will not last long.<br />
        </p>
